## Importing the data

```{r import}

## Gender breakdown

In this block, we're counting the number of men and women who are heads of household, spouses, and respondents to each module and figuring out which modules had more male respondents and which had more female respondents.

## Breaking down and cleaning the dataset

Let's start by dividing the dataset into each separate module and making the sex columns easier to understand.

```{r}

tsiro_fm_data <- tsiro_raw_data%>%
  mutate_at(c("head_sex", "spouse_sex", "mod_b_respondent_sex", "mod_c_respondent_sex", "mod_d_respondent_sex", "mod_e_respondent_sex", "mod_f_respondent_sex", "mod_i_respondent_sex", "mod_h_respondent_sex", "mod_g_respondent_sex", "mod_c_wdd_respondent_sex"), as.character)%>%
  mutate(across(c("head_sex", "spouse_sex", "mod_b_respondent_sex", "mod_c_respondent_sex", "mod_d_respondent_sex", "mod_e_respondent_sex", "mod_f_respondent_sex", "mod_i_respondent_sex", "mod_h_respondent_sex", "mod_g_respondent_sex", "mod_c_wdd_respondent_sex"), str_replace, "1", "M"))%>%
  mutate(across(c("head_sex", "spouse_sex", "mod_b_respondent_sex", "mod_c_respondent_sex", "mod_d_respondent_sex", "mod_e_respondent_sex", "mod_f_respondent_sex", "mod_i_respondent_sex", "mod_h_respondent_sex", "mod_g_respondent_sex", "mod_c_wdd_respondent_sex"), str_replace, "2", "F"))

#### Adding gender back into credit section

starting w some planning...(and thinking out loud in R markdown)

basically...

M+a1 = M

  I, a man, made this decision.  Possibly by myself and possibly with my wife.
  
M+a0 = not M

  I, a man, did not make this decision.  Possibilities: wife made this decision, decision wasn't made at all.
  
F+a1 = F

  I, a woman, made this decision.  Possibly by myself and possibly with my husband.
  
F+a0 = not F

  I, a woman, did not make this decision.  Possibilities: husband made this decision, decision wasn't made at all
  
M+b1 = F

  My spouse, theoretically a woman, made this decision.  Possibilities: I made it with her or she made it by herself.
  update: not necessarily a woman.  Need to double-check spouse's gender.
  
M+b0 = not F

  My spouse, theoretically a woman, did not make this decision.  Possibilities: I made it without her or neither of us made it.
  
F+b1 = M

F+b0 = not M

realizing this assumes every couple in the dataset is straight.  going to check real quick to make sure this is an assumption I can make.  update: it's not.  love that they've found love but darn it messes up my math.

after, I'm imagining each set of columns looking like:

did you borrow from x?

options: 1 (yes), 0 (no)

who made the decision to borrow from x?

options: "M", "F", "MF", "N", "S", "MS", "FS", "MFS", where N is no one and S is someone else (inside or outside household)

factor it by power of the woman in the decision? kinda hard to define, so no

who decided how to use money from x?

options: "M", "F", "MF", "N", "S", "MS", "FS", "MFS", where N is no one and S is someone else (inside or outside household)

etc. for each institution

ok how do I want to go about this?

Might be easiest to create a column M or 0, F or 0, S or 0, and then add them together.  Any still 0 will become N.

Don't bother w columns where the value is 0 - it doesn't provide info that isn't provided elsewhere.

change self to M, F, and 0.  change spouse to M, F, and 0.  change both other columns to S and 0.  concatenate all four into one column.

How to tackle the spouse column?

#### Exploring the empowerment dataset

Okay so a problem coming up here is that in all my adjustments of "you or your partner" data into gender data, I'm assuming the respondent is either the head of household or their spouse, but I have proof in some cases that that assumption is not legitimate, so where else might it not be legitimate?

```{r}
#view(empower)
#glimpse(empower)
empower_real <- empower%>%
  drop_na(mod_h_respondent_sex)%>%
  arrange(desc(mod_h_respondent_sex), partner)%>%
  mutate(male_respondent = ifelse(mod_h_respondent_sex == "M", 1, 0))%>%
  mutate(male_potentially_present = alone + male_respondent)%>%
  filter(mod_h_respondent_sex == "F" | (spouse_sex == "F" & partner == 1))%>%
  arrange(head_sex, spouse_sex, partner)%>%
  view()
#Making sure there is a woman in the household whom the respondent is discussing.
#Filters out men responding who have no wives or whose partners' genders we don't
#know.
#Adds column indicating whether woman in household was speaking for herself with
#no one else present.



```

#### Views on the environment score

```{r}
# glimpse(resources)
resources_views <- resources%>%
  rename(protect = protect_label)%>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("protect_"), ~ .x - 3))
# formatting so operations are easier

resources_views <- resources_views %>%
  mutate(protect_avg = rowMeans(select(resources_views, starts_with("protect_")), na.rm = TRUE), .after = protect_med)%>%
  mutate(protect_sum = protect_avg*8)
# glimpse()
# Calculating priority indicator "Average score measuring the perceived
# importance of protecting nature and the environment".
# Asks about the importance of 8 ecosystem services relevant to this population.

resources_views <- resources_views %>%
  rename("threats_illegal_logging" = "threats_big_a",
         "threats_slash_burn" = "threats_big_b",
         "threats_poaching" = "threats_big_c",
         "threats_wildlife_trafficking" = "threats_big_d",
         "threats_seine_fishing" = "threats_big_e",
         "threats_fishing_other" = "threats_big_f",
         "threats_climate_change" = "threats_big_g",
         "threats_farming" = "threats_big_h",
         "threats_resource_use" = "threats_big_i")

```

I want to look more at unsustainable resource use.  The toolkit says each activity should pick unsustainable practices to look at, so here's a list of what TSIRO collected that I think I could use:
collection of forest products
plans to clear land next year
cleared land last year

do you engage in this activity?
why?
how important is it to you?
how often do you do it?
has this changed over the past year (if so, why)?
perception of ecosystem status in the future? (could take this from threats data)
who makes decisions on engaging in the activity and who engages most in the activity can be disaggregated by gender

Primary indicator here is whether the households engage in the activity, other stuff is just for added context



#### Calculating FIES Percentage

```{r}
# view(foodsec)
#code modified from FAO Voices of the Hungry project report, attached.

foodsec_fies <- foodsec%>%
  mutate(fies_unw_avg = rowMeans(select(foodsec, starts_with("fies_")), na.rm = TRUE), .after = fies_day)
```

#### Calculating PPI

```{r}
view(poverty)

poverty_ppi <- poverty%>%
  mutate(soap_water = as.numeric(water == 1 & (detergent == 1 | detergent == 2)),
         soap_4k = as.numeric(soap > 4000))%>%
  mutate(ppi = (77)*1 + (-13)*food_1 + (-13)*tv + (-12)*food_2 + (-7)*food_3
					+ (-5)*clothes_1 + (-4)*linen_2 + (4)*food_5 + (-4)*clothes_2
					+ (4)*birth + (-4)*food_4 + (-3)*clothes_3
					+ (-3)*soap_water + (-3)*shoes + (2)*children_5_18 + (-2)*linen_1
					+ (-1)*soap_4k + (-1)*roofmat)%>%
  view()

summarise(poverty_ppi, across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.x))))

# I'm using children 5-18 as a stand-in for children 6-11 rn, but that's illegal
# technically.  Will I have to go through IRB review process just to get their
# age group?

```


## Creating narrow dataset

Okay first planning - what do I want in here, section by section?

#### roster

hhid_deid
spouse_sex
gender_hh_type

#### agriculture

hhid_deid
nrm_pract:nrm_pract_g

#### credit

#### resources_views

hhid_deid
mod_f_respondent_sex
trees_plant:trees_other_EN
land_kind_a           did you clear forest for cultivation
clear_where_a         plan to clear land for cultivation
clear_protect         plan to clear protected area
honey, mush, insects, fruits, meat, plants, woods, char, fish     how important are each of these to your livelihood
protect_water:loss_affect   importance of protecting each, have you lost resources, how were you affected?
threats:threat_big_i

#### energy

hhid_deid
starts_with(fuel_sources), starts_with(fuel_men), starts_with(fuel_women) what fuel sources do you use and who spends how much time gathering them

I'm going to want to sum fuel_men variables and fuel_women variables, but might do that after join.

#### poverty

If I could figure out how they calculated PPI from this that would be great

#### foodsec_fies

hhid_deid
fies_enough:fies_unw_avg        fies info
CSI         coping strategies index score
birth       has anyone given birth in this household
mddw        minimum dietary diversity - women

hm.  This is the first time I've gotten a good look at the roster and I'm
looking through the gender hh type and noticing that it doesn't always align
with the recorded head_sex/spouse_sex.  Is the spouse not living at home?  Either
way, this adds another layer of difficulty to my assumption that I can figure out
the gender of a respondent's partner based on this data.  I might just have to
take out any data that required me to assume the gender of the respondent's partner -
or the presence of a partner at all.


Ok questions for 1/12 meeting:
- going to need child_6_11 to accurately calculate PPI.  Would that need IRB approval?  If so, that's not going to get to me in time.
- for any of the you or your partner stuff to be helpful, I think we need to know if they're the head of the household for two reasons:
1. we don't know their marital status/spouse of their partner unless we have that
  a. based on the numbers that less than 1% of HoH couples are same-sex I don't mind assuming all unknown spouses are straight, but for the credit section, I don't even know if they have a partner
2. in the empowerment section we do know whether they have a partner, but we're missing a crucial aspect of their decision making power if we don't know whether they're in the HoH couple.  If I answered the door, I would say I'm not on the deed, but that doesn't mean women have less power in my household, it just means I'm not in the HoH couple

## Miscellaneous Planning - it's old (pre-analysis), so don't worry about this part

Maybe try to incorporate in a gender empowerment index, based on SWPER but modified to this dataset?  Replace unavailable data w similar or similarly relevant data?

Would love to have biodiversity data - it would really add to this

Definitely incorporate score on how much they care about protecting the environment

Is it possible to make a sustainability index?  Should probably incorporate harmful activities (how much deforestation, weighted percentage of unclean fuel use, destructive agriculture practices) and helpful activities (reforestation, resource conservation, sustainably agriculture practices)

Is there a good poverty indicator?  Maybe ask Kelvin's advice on this
